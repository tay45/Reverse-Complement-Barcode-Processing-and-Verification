# Reverse Complement Barcode Processing and Verification

This repository contains two Python scripts designed to work together for processing and verifying DNA sequences. The primary task is to generate reverse complements of DNA sequences from a gzip-compressed file and then verify that these reverse complements have been generated correctly.

Scripts Overview
1. Reverse Complement Barcode Processing
Filename: reverse_complement_barcode.py

This script performs the following tasks:
•	Reverse Complement Calculation:
Calculates the reverse complement of DNA sequences. It handles both uppercase and lowercase nucleotide bases.
•	Barcode Processing:
Reads a gzip-compressed text file containing DNA barcode sequences, processes each line to generate the reverse complement, and writes the results to a new gzip-compressed file.

Usage Example:
# Example script usage for reverse complement processing
input_file = 'input_sequences.txt.gz'
output_file = 'input_sequences-REVERSE-COMPLEMENTED.txt.gz'

process_barcode_file(input_file, output_file)

2. Random Reverse Complement Verification
Filename: verify_reverse_complement.py

This script is designed to verify the integrity of the reverse complement sequences generated by the reverse_complement_barcode.py script. It randomly selects a specified number of sequences from the original input file, computes their reverse complements, and verifies them against the corresponding sequences in the output file.

Usage Example:
# Example script usage for verifying reverse complements
input_file = 'input_sequences.txt.gz'
output_file = 'input_sequences-REVERSE-COMPLEMENTED.txt.gz'

if verify_random_reverse_complements(input_file, output_file):
    print("All sequences verified successfully.")
else:
    print("There were errors in the sequences.")

Requirements
•	gzip (part of Python's standard library)
•	random (part of Python's standard library)

How to Run the Scripts
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/reverse-complement-barcode.git
2. Navigate to the directory:
cd reverse-complement-barcode
3. Run the Processing Script:
Ensure your input barcode file (.txt.gz) is in the same directory as the script or provide the correct path. Then execute the script:
python reverse_complement_barcode.py
This will generate a gzip-compressed output file containing the reverse-complemented sequences.
4. Run the Verification Script:
After generating the reverse complement file, you can verify the results by running the verification script:
python verify_reverse_complement.py
The script will randomly select a specified number of sequences and verify that their reverse complements in the output file match the expected results.

Example Workflow
1. Processing:
Run reverse_complement_barcode.py to create the reverse complement sequences.
2. Verification:
Run verify_reverse_complement.py to check the accuracy of the reverse complements.

Notes
•	The scripts are designed to be general-purpose and should work with any sequence files containing DNA sequences in a gzip-compressed text format.
•	If you are working with very large files, consider modifying the scripts to process the data in chunks to avoid memory issues.
